# What's in a name?

Plenty when talking about whisky - or should it be whiskey?

The "E" does more than annoy spellcheck and cause arguments.

That simple one letter distinction reveals a clue to the origins of what's in your glass and how it got there.

The difference between whisky and whiskey can be attributed to many things, none of which is completely correct, but, when taken as a whole, offers a reasonable explanation. There are cultural and political differences, language barriers, and sometimes just plain stubbornness. At whisky's, or whiskey's, core, though, lies an ancient Gaelic term:

_Uisge beatha_

Loosely translated, it means "water of life" and comes from the Latin aqua vitae. While the origins of early whisky production are murky at best -- something about which historians argue over a dram -- we do know that monks brought the knowledge of distillation with them as the Roman Empire moved North into Europe, eventually reaching modern-day Ireland and the United Kingdom. Those Latin-speaking monks originally learned their skills from the pioneers of distillation in the Middle East and Northern Africa, and among the many things they produced in their stills was something called "al-cool" in Arabic -- a potion used to restore health and well-being to the ill. The Roman monks dubbed it aqua vitae, and since monks were the closest thing to doctors back then, they produced it as a medicine.

As the Roman Empire reached the Gaelic-speaking regions of Europe, aqua vitae was translated into the local tongue as uisge beatha. Even then, slang had a way of creeping into daily life, and uisge beatha became known simply as uisge (pronounced "oo-isk-ee"). As English gradually replaced Gaelic in daily life, the natural translation became simply whisky.

While there may be peace in the United Kingdom and Ireland now, historians will remind us that wasn't always the case. In fact, it could be argued that the two countries where the "e" is most often used in the spelling of whisky are the two countries that broke away from the British Empire by force. "Whiskey" is the common spelling in both the United States and Ireland, while "whisky" is the preferred spelling in Canada as well as Scotland, Wales, and England (along with the rest of the world) today.

However, keep in mind that today, marketing plays as much of a role as politics does in determining whether a brand uses the "e" or not.

Ireland's distillers didn't settle on "whiskey" as a way to tweak the British or Scots. In fact, both spellings were commonly used on Irish whiskies until the country's distilling families joined forces to form Irish Distillers in 1966\. With all of the major Irish whiskey brands under one umbrella, including Bushmills in Northern Ireland, the company settled on a common spelling of "whiskey" for consistency.

There's no mandatory spelling for "whisk(e)y" outside of Scotland, and the choice is up to each distiller (or marketing department) on which spelling it will use. For example, Beam Suntory uses "whisky" on its Maker's Mark Bourbon, while its Jim Beam Bourbons use the "whiskey" spelling. The difference dates back to the early days of Maker's Mark in the 1950's, when co-founders Bill Samuels Sr. and Marge Samuels were establishing their distillery. As their son Bill Samuels Jr. tells it, his mother was responsible for most of what we would call "branding" decisions today, and settled on "whisky" as a way to honor the Scottish emigrants who helped bring whisk(e)y distilling to America. She also created the brand's unique type face, hand-cut labels, and the trademark dripping red wax seal, along with the name "Maker's Mark."

On the other hand, the Beam family had always used "whiskey" on its bottles before Prohibition. When Col. Jim Beam and his branch of the Beams built their new distillery near Clermont, Kentucky at the end of Prohibition, the spelling question was the least of their concerns in trying to get whiskey back into the hands of thirsty consumers before their competitors could. While the two brands are now part of the same corporate family after a series of acquisitions, each brand has retained its own traditional spelling of whisk(e)y.

Whether one uses the "e" or not, there is a common definition of "whisky".

_Whisky is defined as, "an alcoholic distillate from a fermented mash of grain"._

That definition holds whether one is making Single Malt Scotch, Bourbon, Irish, Canadian, moonshine, or any other type of whisky. The specific standards for each type of whisky may vary, but at their core, all whiskies share one thing in common - a heritage of cooked grains fermented and distilled to produce uisge beatha.

That heritage goes back hundreds of years, though historians note the oldest known recorded reference to whisky comes from Ireland in 1405, when a chieftain's death was blamed on "taking a surfeit of aqua vitae" at Christmas. Scottish legends talk of Friar John Cor and a 1494 entry in the Exchequer Rolls for an order of malted barley to be delivered to the monk "by order of the King to make aquavitae". However, it's safe to presume that while those were among the earliest recorded references to whisky, local farmers had already figured out the monks' secret and started making their own uisge beatha - but being largely uneducated, just didn't write it down.

Whisky production grew during the 16th Century after King Henry VIII closed down the kingdom's monasteries, forcing the monks into the general community. Of course, their expertise with distillation quickly made them popular, and the raw, un-aged spirit from their small, portable stills flowed freely. Eventually, governments figured out that taxing whisky could pay for their various wars, palaces, and other "economic development projects" - while those opposed to whisky believed that taxes could help bring an end to what they perceived as general drunkenness and disorder among the population.

The Act of Union in 1707 brought Scotland under the control of Buckingham Palace in London, and the Palace kept raising taxes on their whisky-making subjects in the North. Finally, the infamous English Malt Tax of 1725 forced Scotland's distillers back into the hills, caves, and in the case of Orkney minister Magnus Eunson, underneath the altar of his church to hide his still from the "gaugers" - as the excisemen were known. His still was eventually discovered -- but the exciseman who found it ended up buying it and getting the first license for what we know today as Highland Park Distillery.

By this time, whisky distilling had spread to the New World as farmers from Great Britain and Europe left for the promise of better lives in North America. While rum and Madeira wine were still the drinks of choice for the British elite along the East Coast, the farmers out West soon found that it was easier to turn their surplus grain crops into whisky, which could be bartered or sold more easily.

Those crops included the indigenous corn and rye brought from Europe, along with wheat and barley. This was the case in what we now know as the United States and Canada, as both were commonly under British rule at the time. As Davin de Kergommeaux points out in his book, Canadian Whisky: The Portable Expert, distilling equipment and expertise regularly crossed the border, and the American Revolution may have helped influence Canadian whisky development somewhat as some distillers loyal to the Crown migrated to Canadian territory outside the 13 original states.

In the wake of the Revolutionary War, the new American Government followed their former ruler's lead and imposed taxes on whisky production. In 1791, Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton's plan to pay off the fledging country's war debt included a controversial whisky tax.

In his book Kentucky Bourbon History: An American Heritage, Michael Veach makes the case that this tax discriminated against the country's farmer-distillers in favor of city-based commercial distillers. The tax payments had to be paid in cash, which was difficult in the barter-based rural economy, and were also based on assumptions that distillers were producing whisky full-time, while farmers were distilling for only a few weeks each year following their fall harvest. 

Farmer-distillers fought the tax hike, but nowhere more vehemently than in Western Pennsylvania, where protesters regularly attacked tax collectors. By 1794, the conflict had reached the point where armed and angry distillers surrounded the home of a tax collector sheltering a U.S. Marshal sent to enforce collection orders. President George Washington responded by leading an army of 12,950 soldiers from Pennsylvania and neighboring states to put down what we now call the "Whiskey Rebellion." Cooler heads prevailed, and the protesters left long before Washington's army arrived. While there was no fighting, two protesters were arrested and later pardoned by President Washington.

Ironically, after leaving the Presidency, Washington was persuaded to build a distillery at his Mount Vernon estate in Virginia to supply surrounding merchants with Rye whiskey. At the time of his death in 1799, Washington's Distillery had five stills producing nearly 11,000 gallons of whiskey a year, making it the largest distillery in the United States. The distillery was managed by Washington's Scottish-born farm manager, James Anderson and his brother John Anderson, and six of Washington's slaves were assigned to work at the distillery.

According to Mount Vernon's records, Washington willingly paid the federal taxes on his whiskey, with an excise tax bill of $332 for the 616 gallons of whiskey produced in 1798\.

The distillery was closed by his heirs in 1808, and burned to the ground in 1814\. A restoration project was completed in 2007 with funding from modern-day distillers through the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Today, Mount Vernon sells whiskey made at the distillery using a version of the original recipe to help raise money for its educational programs.

How did Bourbon get its name? Historians disagree, and we will likely never know the actual truth - just as with many legends of whiskey from around the world. While some claim the name was inspired Kentucky's Bourbon County, the fact remains that during those early days, Kentucky was still part of Virginia and the present-day Bourbon County's borders had not been drawn in those pre-statehood days. Others claim it came from Bourbon Street in New Orleans, where whiskey produced in the Midwest often wound up after being shipped in barrels on the Mississippi River. There are others who believe it was a tribute to France's ruling House of Bourbon for supporting the Revolutionary War. Veach examines all three notions, and while no definitive proof exists to prove or disprove any of them, he suggests that the name may have been chosen to help make the whiskey more popular among French-speaking residents in New Orleans and other areas following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803\. In other words -- an early example of marketing.

Of course, one of the best examples of marketing remains a royal endorsement. By the early 1820's, the cat-and-mouse game between illicit distillers and the gaugers had reached legendary proportions, and even though the Excise Act of 1823 had a licensing scheme in place, not one distiller had stepped forward to get a license - either in defiance of the Crown or out of fear of retaliation from other distillers. 

George Smith had been making whisky illegally at his farm near the River Livet in the Highlands for years, but when King George IV publicly asked for a dram of "that Glen Livet" whisky during a visit to Scotland in 1822, Smith -- and his landlord -- saw the opportunity to avoid a crackdown from the gaugers. Smith obtained the first license known to have been issued under the Excise Act for his distillery in 1824\. While there are other distilleries in Scotland that are older, those ages are based on records of what was most likely unlicensed distilling at the time.

The Act applied in Ireland as well, but once licensed distilling became acceptable, legal production skyrocketed. By the end of the 19th Century, Ireland was the world's largest whisky-producing region. However, a combination of factors brought that golden era to an end. The country's distillers ignored the work of their countryman, Aeneas Coffey, who in 1831 developed the column still that produced a lighter, more flavorful whisky than their traditional pot stills. Scotland's distillers and blenders quickly figured out that blending whiskies from the two different types of stills produced a more balanced whisky that was easier to drink -- and sell.

Next, Ireland's War of Independence from 1919-1921 and Prohibition in the U.S. from 1920-1933 cut distillers off from many of their major export markets -- effectively, ending the golden era.

By 1966, the remaining family-owned distilleries merged their businesses to form Irish Distillers and focus their efforts on promoting Jameson to the world while producing other brands for the domestic market. That strategy worked over time, and Irish whiskey is now one of the fastest-growing segments of the global whiskey market led by Jameson, with sales of more than a million cases of whiskey worldwide annually. The Irish Whiskey Association projects at least 26 new or planned distillery projects over the next five years, and has an ambitious goal of tripling Irish whiskey's share of the global whisky market over the next 15 years.

Under the ownership of John Teeling, Cooley Whiskey helped boost the image of Irish whiskey by selling bulk whiskey to independent bottlers for sale under their own brand names, in addition to Cooley's own brands such as Connemara, Kilbeggan, and Tyrconnell. Teeling and his partners sold Cooley to Beam Suntory in 2012, and while the new owner stopped most of its bulk whiskey sales, that has led to a boom in new distillery construction as entrepreneurs try to meet the demand for Irish whiskey. John Teeling and some of his former partners have since teamed up to buy a former Harp Lager brewery and convert it into the Great Northern Distillery using the same business model they perfected at Cooley. Teeling's sons, Jack Teeling and Stephen Teeling, used bulk stocks they acquired from Cooley as part of the sale to launch their own whiskey company, and opened the Teeling Whiskey distillery in Dublin on St. Patrick's Day in 2015\.

While Irish Distillers (now part of Pernod Ricard) has dominated the Irish whiskey market, other major players are eager to jump on the bandwagon. Bourbon-focused Brown-Forman broke ground in the fall of 2015 on its first distillery outside of North America in a partnership with the Conyngham family, which owns Slane Castle near Dublin. The family had been selling its own Slane Castle-branded whiskey, but lost its supply contract with Cooley after the Beam sale and had been working on plans to build its own distillery. After an early partnership fell through, Brown-Forman stepped in to rescue the project and will begin selling a Slane-branded whiskey in 2017 using sourced stocks while its own whiskey matures at the castle.

Scotch whisky-focused William Grant & Sons opened its Tullamore Dew distillery in Tullamore in September of 2014, and is already starting work on an expansion project to double the distillery's capacity. Grant inherited a long-term supply contract with Irish Distillers for Tullamore Dew when it acquired the brand in 2010, and immediately started plans to build its own distillery after realizing the caps on that contract would not be enough to meet current and projected sales growth for the brand. Another family-owned company, Sazerac, has acquired the defunct Michael Collins Irish Whiskey brand (another casualty of Beam's Cooley acquisition) with plans to use its own stocks of sourced whiskey to revive the brand, though no specific date has been announced. Finally, Mexico's Beckmann family, which owns the Jose Cuervo tequila brand, engineered an asset swap with Diageo in 2014 to get control of Bushmills, which had been underperforming under Diageo's ownership.

Canadian whisky production developed on its own course during the 19th Century, with growth coming during the American Civil War from 1861-1865 as whisky production was largely curtailed south of the border. The Molson family originally built its fortune on distilling whisky, but closed its distillery in 1867 to focus on brewing beer. Hiram Walker, William Gooderham, George Russell, and other distillers helped develop the taste of Canadian Rye, which has grown in popularity in recent years thanks to the work of modern-day distillers and blenders like John Hall of Forty Creek and Dr. Don Livermore of Corby Distillers.

Think about this question for a moment. During the first half of the 19th Century, most Scotch whisky was being sold in barrels straight from the distillery - usually to people in the immediate area. In fact, whisky was looked down on in England as a drink fit only for those heathens from the North. How, then, did Scotch Whisky become so popular around the world?

Blame it on the bugs. One specific type of aphid, in fact. This aphid was carried from North America to Europe on ships and is believed to have arrived in France between 1858 and 1863\. While it is known to scientists as Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, the more commonly-known name is grape phylloxera. The aphid feeds on grape vines, and decimated vineyards throughout Europe as it spread quickly. With wine, brandy, and the like in short supply, thirsty Europeans found themselves looking for an alternative. Around this time, Scottish grocers and tea blenders such as Andrew Usher, John Walker, and James Chivas were blending pungent, powerful malt whiskies with the lighter whiskies produced in Aeneas Coffey's column stills. Their work resulted in smoother, more complex whiskies that were not only easier to drink, but could be produced in larger quantities with more consistency. Those blends caught on quickly in London, Paris, and other European cities, and ships leaving Glasgow and Edinburgh for ports worldwide were soon filled with Scotch Whisky. The wine industry eventually recovered after phylloxera-resistant American vines were grafted to the European vines, but not before whisky had become one of the world's favorite spirits. 

American whisky producers made a slow comeback after the end of Prohibition in 1933\. Bourbon reclaimed its place as America's most popular whisky in the 1950's and 60's, but by the mid-80's, sales and interest in Bourbon and other American whiskies had declined dramatically as consumers switched to wines and lighter spirits. Distilleries closed around the country, with Kentucky Bourbon production falling to around 300,000 barrels statewide in 1987\.

A renewed interest in whisky worldwide during the last 15 years has pushed Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey back into the spotlight, with U.S. distillers exporting more than $1.02 billion worth of American whisky worldwide during 2014, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the US. Bourbon production in Kentucky alone has exceeded 1 million barrels in each of the last four years (2011-2014), and the state's distillers have invested $400 million to expand their facilities between 2008 and 2013, with new projects announced on a regular basis.

While we have largely focused on the traditional whisky-making countries until now, whisky production has expanded worldwide, and fortunately, the history of that development is much more documented. For instance, while we will never know exactly who produced the first uisge beatha in Scotland or Ireland, how Bourbon got its name or whether the practice of charring barrels can be attributed to a distiller who wanted to re-use a fish barrel without getting a fishy taste in his whisky -- we do know who gets the credit for the development of whisky in Japan. The Taketsuru family had been making sake for decades when Masataka Taketsuru was sent to Glasgow to study chemistry during the summer of 1919\. He developed an interest in distilling, and with his new wife Rita, spent part of 1920 working at Campbeltown's Hazelburn Distillery before returning to Japan.

There, he worked for the family-owned business of Torii Shinjiro that we know today as Suntory, and built the Yamazaki distillery in 1923\. Taketsuru split from Shinjiro in 1934 over a disagreement on the site for a second distillery, and while Shinjiro went ahead with his plans for the Hakushu distillery near Mt. Fuji, Taketsuru built his own Yoichi distillery on Hokkaidio and founded what is now known as Nikka Whisky. Today, Suntory (now known as Beam Suntory after its $16 billion acquisition of Beam, Inc. in 2014) is the world's third-largest spirits company. Nikka is owned by Japan's Asahi Brewing, and operates the original Yoichi distillery and the Miyagikyo distillery near Sendai in northern Japan.

Rye and barley remain staple crops through much of central Europe, and with the rich brewing heritage in Germany, Belgium, the Czech Republic, and other European nations, it is only natural that some brewers would turn their attention to distilling. Whisky is being made from the Italian and French Alps at distilleries like Puni and Domaine des Hautes Glaces all the way north to Sweden's Box Distillery, where a line painted on the warehouse floor marks the 60º degrees north latitude line.

In Australia, another country with a heritage of brewing, but little in distilling, Bill Lark spent years challenging local Tasmanian laws that had essentially banned small-scale distilleries since 1839\. He and Lyn Lark eventually succeeded in getting the law changed, and opened their Lark Distillery in Hobart in 1992\. With a climate very similar to Scotland's, Tasmania has proven to be a very good place to make whisky, and the Larks opened the door for what has become a cottage industry with at least a dozen craft distilleries following in their footsteps. While the Larks merged their operations with Hobart's Overeem Distillery in 2014, Bill Lark is still regarded as the "father of Australian Whisky." Tasmania Distillery, also located in Hobart, received Whisky Magazine's World Whiskies Award in 2014 as the "Best Single Malt in the World" for one of its whiskies matured in French Oak wine casks.

The 2015 winner of that award comes from another non-traditional whisky-making country, and once again, changes in the law helped make it possible. While Taiwan has always been a good market for Scotch Whisky sales, the island's government held a monopoly on liquor production and banning all private-sector distilling of whisky. However, Taiwan was forced to give up that monopoly as a condition of joining the World Trade Organization in 2002\. T.T. Lee, founder of the King Car Group, had not only a passion for whisky, but a food and beverage company ready to jump into whisky production. King Car built a distillery using Scottish-built stills next to its bottled water plant in Yi-Lan Province in 2005, and the first Kavalan bottling was released in 2008\. Master blender Ian Chang and the distillery's consultant, Dr. Jim Swan, have teamed up to create a number of award-winning single malts, with their Solist Vinho Barrique single cask winning the Whisky Magazine award in 2015\. King Car is currently in the middle of an expansion project that will increase its annual production from 1.5 million liters of spirit annually to nine million liters by the end of 2016\.

And then, there's India.

It's said to be the largest whisky-consuming country in the world. However, the vast majority of that "whisky" is domestically-produced using molasses instead of grain and flavored to taste like grain-based whisky. To the rest of the world, that's not whisky, but rum, and the European Union refuses to allow it to be sold as "whisky". While the diplomats argue over India's demands that other countries accept its definition, two distillers are producing single malt whiskies that not only meet the world's standards - but have won awards in international competitions. Bangalore-based Amrut started making malt whisky in the 1980's to blend with whiskies imported from Scotland, but the Jagdale family decided to start bottling their single malt on its own in 2o04\. In 1992, entrepreneur Paul John established John Distilleries Ltd. in Goa to produce Indian-style whiskies, brandy, and wine. He later moved into single malt whisky, following Amrut's path in using barley grown in northern India near the Himalayas to make single malt. Both distilleries have been successful in making whiskies that mature at a younger age in India's tropical climate, where evaporation rates can reach 10-12 percent per year.

In this chapter, we'll cover the fundamentals of whisky production, from the grains and yeast in fermentation to distilling, maturation, and other considerations which go into the bottles of whisky you buy. While this digital book does not hold enough insight or knowledge to make you a distiller, we hope it does enhance your whisky journey.
