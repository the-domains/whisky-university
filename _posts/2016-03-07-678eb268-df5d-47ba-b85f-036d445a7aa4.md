# WhiskyCast University Welcome

There is more than one type of whisky, and there is more than one way to tell the stories of whisky. You can explore the first part of **The Craft and Adventure of Making Whisky** by listening to audio segments, watching video clips and exploring photo galleries, to name a few. 

The website you are looking at is based on the iBook published on iTunes.  This website is generated with an experiment web authoring tool called, "The Grid." It uses AI, artificial intelligence, to create the interface.  Let us know how you like it, and it all the bells and whistles don't quite work yet, WhiskyCast will produce a back-up website run on WordPress.

Our hope is that this website will bring as close as to the whisky experience as possible by engaging you in multimedia. In fact, just about the only way you can't investigate whisky is by smelling and tasting it. Shucks. That would have been fun. We'll work on that.
