# Whisky Life

Whisky, as a whole, is viewed as distinct from other spirits. Perhaps it is the history or the flavor profile, but one rarely meets someone casually involved with whisky.

From the ah-ha moment at first sip, there's a bond.

Whisky offers a heritage and connection that goes back centuries and spans generations, with stories and memories passed down over time. 

This passion for whisky is reflected in the hundreds of thousands of visitors to distilleries every year -- and those numbers are growing.

At the end of 2014, the Kentucky Distillers Association reported a 12 percent annual increase in visitors along the Kentucky Bourbon Trail.

Scottish tourism officials reported 1.2 million people visited distilleries that year, while Aoife Kenne, the head of the Irish Whiskey Association predicts whisky will bring at least one million visitors to Ireland in 2015\.

As with any consumer product, making whisky is a manufacturing process.

Yet, while millions of people worldwide use Procter & Gamble's Tide laundry detergent, few plan a vacation to tour the plant or ask the plant manager to sign a bottle for them. That's the passion that drives whisky lovers, and it's unique in the spirits industry.

## THE ORGINS OF WCU

At WhiskyCast, we frequently receive e-mails at requesting a "crash course" from people embarking on their whisky journey.

Typically, the e-mails come from people who have started listening to the WhiskyCast Weekly Podcast to learn about whisky, and most decide to listen from the very first episode -- which aired in 2005\. 

We love WhiskyCast marathoners, and our response to the requests for a "cheat sheet" is always the same: One can quickly grasp the difference between a whisky, a Bourbon, and a Scotch -- but to truly learn about whisky takes time.  

Each cask of whisky cradles its own unique character. Uncovering each character's story -- learning about whisky -- evolves as you take the journey. 

We also get comments from long-time community members who want to go more in-depth into a particular subject.

With the launch of the next generation of WhiskyCast.com in 2013, we started adding expanded interviews and in-depth stories on the web site.

While these enhanced stories help us be more detailed, we want to put them in greater context. 

Our long-term plan for WhiskyCast has always contained a learning element, and we have started and stopped this project many times over the past four years.

If there is one thing everyone knows about whisky, it's that making a good one takes time.

In order to develop the type of experience we wanted WhiskyCast University to be, we had four principles in mind:

WhiskyCast University must possess strong editorial integrity and production standards and uphold our privacy standards;

We had to have the resources to provide content for new courses at least twice a year;

We had to have the resources to create interactive with the user, and ultimately as WCU expands, between other students of WCU;

WCU content had to be free to the WhiskyCast community.

After four years of development and project delays, we're launching WCU with this debut course, and we appreciate your patience.

WhiskyCast University opened its doors because you asked for another way to explore the world of whisky. We skipped the campus ground-breaking ceremonies, and promise to never ask for donations to the endowment fund. WCU doesn't have a football team, mascot or alumni parties -- yet. What we have is you, and we look forward to creating the type of educational experience you as a community have always wanted.

We encourage you to use the content of each course as the framework for discussion on www.whiskycast.com/wcu, and to keep watch for announcements of live Skype chats coming in the next months.

In the meanwhile, send us questions or feedback at comments@whiskycast.com, or post on the WhiskyCast Facebook Page or tweet @whiskycast on Twitter.
